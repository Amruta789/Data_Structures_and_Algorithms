Collection of connected nodes.

List head -> 
 ________    ________
|____|___|->|____|___|  
  node 1      node 2	

Each node contains data part and address part.

These nodes connect to the next node using a pointer.	

The head pointer contains the address of the first node.

The last nodes address part is NULL.

If tail node contains adress of first node rather than NULL, it is a circular linked list.

A DLL or a double linked list has a data part and two addresses or link parts(next (successor)and previous(predecessor)) for traversal in two directions.
